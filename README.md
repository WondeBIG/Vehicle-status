# Rotable Components Maintenance & Availability Analysis - SQL Queries

## Overview

This repository contains SQL queries designed to track rotable component maintenance, service requests, and operational status. The queries analyze downtime trends, maintenance classification, and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) to optimize fleet and component management.

These queries are structured for scalability, performance optimization, and seamless integration with BI tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Mode Analytics.

Queries Included

 ## Rotable Components Service Availability
Objective: Track operational status and service disruptions for critical fleet components (Batteries, Wings, and Bodies).

 ## Key Metrics:
 * Current Status (UP/DOWN)
 * Maintenance Type (Routine vs. Non-Routine)
 * Number of Service Requests per Component
	
 Use Case: Improve asset utilization and reduce downtime.

## Rotable Maintenance & Repair Efficiency
Objective: Calculate Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and analyze Jira ticket resolution trends for rotable components.

## Key Metrics:
* Date Grounded & Date Resolved
* Jira Ticket Status & Assignee
* MTTR Calculation in Days

Use Case: Reduce maintenance backlogs and improve repair turnaround times.


## Conclusion

These queries provide critical insights into rotable component maintenance and service tracking, helping teams:
* Monitor component availability & maintenance trends.
* Measure Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) per component.
* Improve asset reliability and fleet readiness.
* Reduce maintenance delays by tracking Jira ticket resolution times.

### Future Enhancements:
* Predictive maintenance modeling for fleet health forecasting.
* Automated downtime analysis dashboards for real-time monitoring.
